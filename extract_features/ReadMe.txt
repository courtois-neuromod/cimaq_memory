Overview of the extract_features directory content (WIP)

- 1 python script
(add another to create network feature maps?)
- 2 jupyter notebooks

The cimaq_getbetas.py script:

Input:
-t: path
-m:
-f:
-o:

produces brain maps of beta weights;
each map reflects the modeling of the hemodynamic response
(spm model; in Nistats) for a single trial.

- CIMAQ_getBetaMaps.ipynb: jupyter notebook detailing how to
compute beta maps, using a single participant as an example.

- CIMAQ_getNetworkFeatures.ipynb: jupyter notebook detailing how
to compute network activation features, using a single participant
as an example.
