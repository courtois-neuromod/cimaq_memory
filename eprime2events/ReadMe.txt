Overview of the eprime2events directory content:

- 1 python script: cimaq_convert_eprime_to_bids_event.py
- 2 .json files describing the headers of the script's output files

The cimaq_convert_eprime_to_bids_event.py script :

Input:
 -d: path to directory that contains a series of zipped
 directories (will be under /cimaq_memory/TaskFiles/Zipped)
 format = pscid_dccid_Tache_IRM.zip
 -o: path to output directory where output files will be saved
(eventually TaskFiles/Processed)

There is one zipped directory per participant,
each containing the following 3 .txt files
generated by eprime at the time of testing:
- Onset-Event-Encoding_CIMAQ_*.txt
- Output_Retrieval_CIMAQ_*.txt
- Output-Responses-Encoding_CIMAQ*.txt
Note: one zip file is included in Dropbox to test the script:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1ijtytsqu3zghec/AAAnzupem2TA45EGyW9QpuH9a?dl=0

Output:
two .tsv files per participant (saved under /cimaq_memory/TaskFiles/Processed)

- sub-**-ses-4_task-memory_events.tsv (** = dccid)
This file is used to create event files in Nistats/Nilearn (to label fMRI frames)
Note: the TaskFile_headers_CIMAQ_memory.json file describes the metrics
found in each column

- PostScanBehav_pscid*_dccid**.tsv (* = pscid, ** = dccid)
This file is to assess a participant's performance on the post-scan
memory task (image and source recognition).
Note: the PostScanBehav_CIMAQ_memory.json file describes the metrics
saved in each column
